All boxes are responsive, and the grid layout remains intact if more content is added to the boxes.

The box and component CSS selectors are shared. each box has a dynamic "box-#" style which is assigned to the grid area 
and there are two unique main-1 main-2 sections.

I decided to go with CSS-grid the whole time rather than switching between a flex layout to keep things clean.

The CSS is mobile-first, and the color functions are imported from a utils folder.

The entire project uses TypeScript.
